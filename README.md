# Prioritized_topic_based_crawler
A web crawler to get documents based on topics and their priorities, managed by a frontier management system using python. Indexed documents using Elasticsearch, Kibana and developed a vertical search engine with query highlighting.

 Develop a web crawler, and crawl Internet documents to construct a document collection focused on a particular topic - "American independence war".
 It conforms strictly to the politeness policy. Once the documents are crawled, they are pooled together, indexed and search is implemented.

The PageRank of every page in the crawl is computed and lists the top 500 pages by the PageRank score.
